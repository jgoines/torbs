> The Debugger is only to be used if there are problems with STARTING the mission (like finding world map).
> If you can enter missions successfully, then the debugger will probably not help you.
> If it is a sync issue, then it is up to you to create your own sync image file
> A video guide for creating sync image files will be up sometime soon.

How to Use Debugger:
- Open SWTOR and stand around in your ship
- Open Debugger.exe
- Press Z once, and monitor the numbers that jump around on the debugger
- Continue pressing Z SLOWLY, waiting for the screen to adjust itself
- After around 5 times, if successful, the debugger should finish and pop up a message
- Also, the your debugger numbers should match the numbers provided by me on it
- If this happens, then it was successful
- If not, then it was not - please email me
- When you run UntzBot40x.exe, change the theme to CUSTOM
- MAKE SURE NOT TO RUN UNTZBOT40.EXE - it will wipe your debugger settings

To Use:
- Run DeathCheck.exe
- Run UntzBotxx.exe
- Change your settings etc
- Login/Enter free mode
- Select the mission you want to use
- Select play/record more with 'R'
- Press 'Q' to start
- If recording, press 'E' to stop the recording
- Press 'X' to close the bot
- Press 'F' to close DeathCheck

Tips to get it working:
- Resolution (in game) 800x600
- Windows Aero Theme
- Game Windowed Mode
- Reset your computer
- When trading scripts, make sure timer files are the same or else it is pointless (or just annoying/impossible to sync)
- Change interface to default AFTER resizing. Change to something else then default if you need to.

InGame tips:
- Do not do super fast movements - it currently records 13~ moves per second, so SOME things are missed
- When shooting missiles, hold it down for half a second longer than usual due to the point above
- Do not press more than one '1234' key at a time - it records only one at a time (shouldn't be an issue)

Event Sync help:
- If the mission does not detect the correct event after 30 seconds, it will exit and retry.
- If it does this continuously, go here : http://www.untz.byethost9.com/howto2.php : to create your own event to sync

Timer Sync help:
- If the mission does not detect the timer, it will simply fail/die, and DeathCheck will attempt to retry.
- If it does this continuously, go here : http://www.untz.byethost9.com/howto.php : to create your own timer file to sync.

Common Errors:
- Looking for world map : Make sure the bottom right corner of your screen is not being blocked by anything
- Looking for galaxy map : Make sure the correct language is selected, and bottom left is not blocked.
- The mission is not selected due to being slightly off : Make sure the right windows theme is selected
- Looking for timer : See above
- Looking for event : See above
- Bad Syncing : Make a better recording
- AutoIt Errors : Update AutoIt
- Anything else : Ask in forum threads
- Cant Donate via Paypal : Sorry, only paypal is accepted right now. Will try to do something about it in the future.
- Galaxy Map Misclicks : Change to 100% DPI
